00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.540
What does ohana mean?

2
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.320
Family.

3
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.160
Ohana means family.

4
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.660
Maybe you would be better off in new york.

5
00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.860
You could get around easier.

6
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.380
Is my culiana.

7
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.740
This is our ohana's land.
Not like you.

8
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.500
I'm going to die before I leave.
I think.

9
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.460
Kuliana, to me, is deeper than just what

10
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.860
we translate it as,
which is responsibility.

11
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.860
As hawaiians, we know that
it's so much more than that.

12
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.180
It's not only a responsibility,
but a privilege.

13
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.620
We have kuliana.

14
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.220
Our culiana here is to our
aina to protect our land.

15
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.180
Kuliana to our ohana.

16
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.460
And our community is
uplifted and doing well.

17
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:58.180
It's spiritual,
and it manifests physically, emotionally,

18
00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.800
socially, and it's all
encompassing, really.

19
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.980
I love the ocean in general.

20
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.820
Coming from an island

21
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.410
nation, the ocean is our aina and where we
get our food and how we meet our cousins

22
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.210
and other places, it's
that which connects us.

23
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.980
I spent my life being
a competitive surfer.

24
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.490
I never really wanted my children to be

25
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.380
professional athletes in surfing, but
I did want them to be ocean people.

26
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.780
One of my favorite boards has a pin tail
so good for, like, barrels and stuff.

27
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.480
When there's a set coming and we don't

28
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.850
want everyone to know, I'll just
yell ibaho, which means outside.

29
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.850
And then all three of us
will start paddling out.

30
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.560
Everybody's like, oh, what's going on?

31
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.460
It's weird because a lot of people don't

32
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.850
think about surfing as
a cultural practice.

33
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.100
It's actually been a cultural practice way
longer than it's been a sport, really.

34
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.740
The ocean is our source of happiness
and grounding, and a lot of this.

35
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.660
Is that we have

36
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.140
the next generation of ocean stewards are
going to be these keiki that have

37
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.860
confidence within themselves, and because
of that self confidence and that MAS, will

38
00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.360
also recognize their
responsibility to the ocean.

39
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.640
Food is such a vehicle for conveying your

40
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.980
feelings, conveying your
aloha for somebody.

41
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.980
What do you guys love about cooking?

42
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.220
Taste testing.

43
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.540
Taste testing.

44
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.100
The best food to me, is the food that
makes you want to eat it with others.

45
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.660
Yeah.

46
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.540
Because really, no matter how good your
stew is, if it doesn't remind you of

47
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.610
something comforting or home,
it's not really that good.

48
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.380
Right.

49
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.540
You're not just hitting
something with a stone.

50
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.020
You're connecting yourself back to your
ancestors, to your kupuna, to the families

51
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.500
before you, to your ohana,
connecting to your very existence.

52
00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.740
I wasn't fortunate enough to grow up

53
00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:05.100
seeing my ancestors kui, but
I'm just really happy that I have that

54
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.610
ability to have my
children grow up, see me.

55
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.660
Kui almost magical.
Yeah.

56
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.180
The way that their hands move and
the way the stone hits the food.

57
00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.980
I'm not sure if they totally understand at
this point in life, but I hope that as

58
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.060
they become adults
themselves, they understand.

59
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.100
I have a couliana.

60
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.820
I have a sense of responsibility
to represent it properly.

61
00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.960
We always feel the need to feed people.

62
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.300
What is that?

63
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.280
Hawaiian.

64
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.460
Oleo really?

65
00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.140
Is the language of this place.

66
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.180
That deep connection from our land, from
our stories, from our songs, from our

67
00:03:54.210 --> 00:04:02.120
chant, from our hula noka
nayakila K-E-A kuala nayakila.

68
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.220
In many ways, our oleo was under attack,
was almost completely obliterated.

69
00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.940
Three of my grandparents are hawaiian.

70
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.100
As adults, none of them spoke hawaiian.

71
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.660
I grew up with this komahal sadness that

72
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:22.540
olelo was something that was within our
reach but lost in my family even to today.

73
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.940
I would have expected there to be a bigger

74
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:33.080
community of hawaiian language speakers
than there actually is right now.

75
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.300
English shouldn't be the
main language of the world.

76
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.820
We should value the thousands of

77
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.620
indigenous languages around or
native languages that we have.

78
00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.300
And we really should bring that back

79
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.820
because so much is lost,
so much culture is lost.

80
00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:51.980
When we lose the language.

81
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.680
It needs to be a treasure that we
take care of and we help to grow.
