# Accessibility App

This research project was focused on exploring website accessibility for all users, regardless of their abilities. The project aimed to provide users with as many tools as possible to make the website easily accessible, such as descriptions for cognitive understanding, multiple resources with transcripts and captions, and multimedia that provides music and audio player controls for screen reader and keyboard accessibility. The project highlights the importance of accessibility in web design and the need to consider the diverse needs of all users.
